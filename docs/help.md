### Map

The map tab is the default tab that will be visible when you open the app. It allows you to search around the area and look at the different interests around the pond.

![Screenshot of map tab][screenshotMap]

#### Base map

The map uses Google Maps to visualise the Fleet Pond area. You can switch to satellite view using the button in the top left corner. Points of interest, routes and your location can be shown on the map.

#### Points of interest markers

![Red marker][markerRed]

Points of interest are shown with red markers on the map. Clicking on one will show the name of the interest and clicking on that will take you to the page about that point of interest.

![Blue marker][markerBlue]

The blue markers show the location of benches.

#### Location

![Location marker][markerLocation]

If you allow the app to use your location, it will be shown with a blue dot with pulsating rings. The persistent ring shows how accurate your location reading is.

**Your location is only used locally on your device, and is not stored anywhere.**

#### Map buttons

There are two buttons available in the bottom right of the screen.

![Location button][buttonLocation]

The location button, only shown if your gps location is available, will lock the map to your location keeping your position centred on the map. The button will glow blue when locked to your location, tap the button again to disable the location lock. The map will only be centred to your location while you have an accurate reading.

![Map button][buttonMap]

The map button centres you back onto the pond, resetting to the default map view.

#### Key

The content of the map can be shown / hidden using the key on the left. The available map content:

* **Interests** - The red markers on the map that show the locations of the points of interests.
* **Benches** - The blue markers on the map that show the locations of the benches around the pond.
* **Routes** - Each route can be individually hidden from the map.

You can use the chevron at the top of the key to show / hide the window.

There is a card for each point of interest at Fleet Pond. Each card contains the interest name, the start of the description, and a picture of the interest or the view that can be seen from the interest. The card also contains icons to show which trails can be used to access the point of interest.

Clicking anywhere on the card will take you to the point of interest page, described below.

Below the image there is a card that shows other details about the point of interest. The "View on map" link will go to the map tab and select the point of interest, showing you where it is on the map. The coloured icons show which routes can be used to access this point of interest, and below that is the point of interest description.
